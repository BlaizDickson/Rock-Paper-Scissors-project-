# Rock-Paper-Scissors-project-
this is a project to play Rock Paper Scissors using javaScript in the following steps below
creat a blank HTML document to link external js file
start with a function called "getComputerChoice" that will randomly return "Rock", "paper" || "scissors"
Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissirs gamethat takes two parameters- the playerSelection and computerSection - and then return a string that declares a winner of the round like so: "You lose! paper beats Rock"
Make the function's playerSelection parameter case insensitive 
Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end
